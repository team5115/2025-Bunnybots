Prompt:
    "Turn this checklist for integrating code onto a robot into a poem in the style of Dante's Divine Comedy.
    Make it one (or two) stanzas."
ChatGPT Response: 
    Change sensors first—record their names and IDs true,
    Set pneumatics’ piston in rightful face, forward or back its destined place;
    Assign each SparkMAX number through and through,
    Then zero swerve and arm so none fall out of grace.

    Next test the motors’ turning paths to see which way they yearn to roam,
    And end with SysId’s solemn rite,
    Where force and motion find their proper home.
